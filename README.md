This document is about a tech product launch that is a smartwatch.
I have used basic tags like html, body, head, etc.
I have also used inline and internal styling using style tags.
To insert image, img tag with properties src, alt and width has been used.
To navigate user to other website, anchor tag is used.
Table tag has been used to create a comparision table.
Ordered and unordered lists are created using ol and ul tags and li(list item) tags inside it.
Other tags like br and other styling tags have also been used.
